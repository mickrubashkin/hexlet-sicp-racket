; Define a constructor make-center-percent 
; that takes a center and a percentage tolerance and produces the desired interval.
; You must also define a selector percent that produces the percentage tolerance for a given interval.
; The center selector is the same as the one shown above.

(define (make-center-percent c p)
  (let ((w (* c (/ p 100))))
    (make-interval (- c w) (+ c w))))
