; A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a pair of vectors 
; â€”the vector running from the origin to the start-point of the segment, 
; and the vector running from the origin to the end-point of the segment. 
; Use your vector representation from Exercise 2.46 to define a representation 
; for segments with a constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment.
