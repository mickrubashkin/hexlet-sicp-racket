; Define the below operation for painters. 
; Below takes two painters as arguments. 
; The resulting painter, given a frame, 
; draws with the first painter in the bottom of the frame 
; and with the second painter in the top. 

; Define below in two different waysâ€”first by writing a procedure 
; that is analogous to the beside procedure given above, 
; and again in terms of beside and suitable rotation operations (from Exercise 2.50).
